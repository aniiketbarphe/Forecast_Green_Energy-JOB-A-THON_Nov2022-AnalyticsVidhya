**1) Problem Statement:-**

Welcome to Green - A country well known for its greenery and natural resources. Green is working towards the betterment of the environment, natural resources, and health of citizens. Over the past few years, Green has improvised its natural resources by enabling the technologies for a safer future. 

The major investment happened to be in renewable energy. As of today, renewable energy contributes to 60% of the total energy capacity in the country. By 2030, the target is to generate 95% of the total energy through renewable energy.

In order to achieve this objective, the government of Green Energy would like to use Data Science to understand the total energy demand of the country in the near future. This will help the government to build the infrastructure and technologies to achieve 95% of the total energy capacity via renewable energy.

They have captured the estimated total energy demand from the past 12 years on an hourly basis. Now, the government of Green Energy is looking for a data scientist to understand the data and forecast the total energy demand for the next 3 years based on past trends.

Help Green! Save Nature! Stay Healthy!

**2) Objective:-**

Your task at hand is to build a machine learning/deep learning approach to forecast the total energy demand on an hourly basis for the next 3 years based on past trends.
